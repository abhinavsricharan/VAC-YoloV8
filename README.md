üìå Project Overview
This project introduces an AI-driven Smart Traffic Management System designed to revolutionize urban mobility. 
By leveraging YOLOv8 for real-time vehicle detection, DeepSORT for tracking, and Google Maps API for route optimization, the system enables intelligent traffic signal control, emergency vehicle prioritization, and data-driven traffic analytics.
The framework minimizes dependence on manual traffic control and optimizes traffic flow while ensuring faster response times during emergencies.

‚ú® Key Features
Real-Time Vehicle Detection & Classification - Uses YOLOv8 and DeepSORT to detect and track Light Motor Vehicles (LMVs), Heavy Motor Vehicles (HMVs), and emergency vehicles.
Adaptive Traffic Signal Control - Dynamically modifies signal timings based on traffic density and vehicle composition to reduce congestion.
Emergency Vehicle Prioritization - Automatically detects ambulances, fire trucks, and police vehicles, granting them priority by switching signals to green.
Scalable Smart City Integration - Can be deployed across multiple intersections with centralized dashboards for monitoring, analytics, and coordinated signal control.
Environmental Benefits - Reduces idle times, fuel consumption, and carbon emissions, contributing to sustainable urban infrastructure.
